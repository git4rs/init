- To dump all digest in file. This creates filename *dig*                         
`bash get_digest_list 127.0.0.1 3000 test demo`
                                                                                
- Walk through "dig" file and read large list bin from source cluster and insert it into destination cluster          
 
`python ldt_backup.py -ntest -ddig -sdemo -blbin -h127.0.0.1 -p3000 -y127.0.0.1 -z3000`

options for scripts are

-d digest file (File generated by dump script)

-y destination host
